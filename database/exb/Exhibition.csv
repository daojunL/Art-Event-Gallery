exb0001|Claude Monet (1840–1926) breathed fresh life into the art of painting. With a bold vision and radical approach that included a vibrant palette and visible brushwork, he proposed a new way of seeing and depicting the world. Artists and collectors came to France from near and far—from the US, Japan, and all over Europe—with hopes of meeting Monet and purchasing his work. His impact was far reaching and today his works are beloved around the globe.
exb0002|“Lucian Freud: The Self-Portraits” charts the artistic development of the renowned British figurative painter through the unique lens of self-portraiture. Best known for his portraits of his acquaintances, Lucian Freud (1922–2011) painted his subjects with compositional ingenuity, technical virtuosity, and a critical eye, and was no less rigorous when depicting himself. Freud returned to self-portraiture repeatedly over almost seven decades, creating a body of work that stands as one of the most sustained achievements of his career.
exb0003|Can a self-portrait depict more than just an artist’s physical appearance? The dozens of contemporary works on paper in “Personal Space,” ranging from straightforward representations of the self to more conceptual renderings, show an expanding definition of self-portraiture.
exb0004|Works by Patty Chang and Marilyn Minter subvert idealized images of women by introducing an element of the grotesque. In Hand to Mouth (2000), Chang parodies the superficial roles women occupy in fetish films, while Minter’s Green Pink Caviar (2009) features an artfully made-up mouth lapping and regurgitating green slime in slow motion—blurring the line between desire and disgust.
exb0005|An artist who played a role in the transition from Impressionism to abstract art, Félix Vallotton isn’t as well known as contemporaries such as Van Gogh, Cézanne and Seurat. Hailing from the French-speaking part of Switzerland, Valloton was a founding member of Les Nabis, a collection of young Parisian artists who were the first to espouse the idea that a painting was first and foremost “a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order,” as another member, Maurice Denis, wrote in 1890. Vallotton’s own work—landscapes, portraits, genre scenes—followed the flatness formula, especially in his stark, black and white woodcuts whose graphics remains surprisingly radical. Voloton’s most striking efforts, however, were his bourgeois interiors, in which domesticity plays out as a drama of existential unease.
exb0006|This splendid exhibition at the Met covers a part of history that isn’t well known in the United States: the period, spanning more than a millennium, in which a succession of kingdoms and empires enriched by gold and trade routes—Ghana (circa 300–1200 C.E.), Mali (1230–1600), Songhai (1464–1591), Bamana (1712–1861) and the Umarian state (1850–90)—rose and fell along a swath of West Africa called the Sahel, or “coast,” by Arabic caravan drivers, an apt description for a region hugging the southern rim of the Sahara like the shore of a vast ocean of sand. These peoples produced magnificent expressions of art and architecture, including regal equestrian sculptures and soaring mosques made from mud; they also developed a rich oral tradition of epic poetry, not unlike the tales of Homer.
exb0007|This re-installation of The Met’s holdings of 17th-century Dutch painting brings together masterpieces by Rembrandt, Hals, Vermeer, and others in a thematically arranged hanging that presents these treasures from Holland’s Golden Age in a whole new light.
exb0008|Lasting from 1919 to 1933, the Weimar period in Germany was known for cutting-edge art that captured the artistic freedom—and decadence—of those years. The same qualities suffuse the images of Dora Kallmus (1881–1963), an Austrian-Jewish photographer who went by the name Madame d’Ora. She became acclaimed for her Deco-style fashion spreads and society portraits, with figures such as Pablo Picasso, Josephine Baker and Collette posing for her. In keeping with the Weimar zeitgeist, her photos were often racy or dissolute in tone. This show is the largest ever presented of her work in the United States.
